To connect iCloud Reminders (also used for the iOS Reminders and OS X
Reminders apps) with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "iCloud
Reminders." Taco will present more specific instructions for making 
reminder lists available to Taco.

# Behavior

Taco imports all reminders in the reminder list(s) you share with Taco.

## Options

If you set "Remind me on" dates for tasks that aren't relevant until
then, Taco ignore tasks with "Remind me on" dates set (until the day
before the reminder). 

Also, Taco can ignore recurring tasks until the day before the next
occurrence.

These options are shown in the connector settings and are enabled by
default.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g ic` (as in "go to
iCloud") to open Instapaper in a new browser tab.
