# Setup

To connect Evernote with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Evernote." Evernote will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Evernote tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/evernote/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Most Evernote users keep tasks in one of two forms:

* As checkboxes within one note or a few notes, like "Things to do." In
  this case, each un-checked checkbox is a task
  ([example](http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/09/14/quick-tip-friday-create-checklists-faster-with-auto-checkboxes/)).
* As a note per task, often with more details in the note itself. In
  this case, each note name is a task. These might be tagged with
  "tasks" or simply identified by name, like "To do: wash the dishes."

Taco works with either or both. After linking Evernote, you'll see this:

![Evernote settings]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/evernote/settings.png)

Enable either or both options based on whether you keep tasks as notes
or as checkboxes inside a note. Next, tell Taco which notebooks, notes,
or tags to examine. Taco uses the same Evernote 
[searches](http://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/search_grammar.php#Search_Terms),
which work on evernote.com.

Here are a few common cases. If we can help find the perfect search for
your Evernote tasks, just contact us.

## I have a single task list note called "Task list"

Enable the checkboxes option. For "Only notes matching..", enter the
name of the note (surrounded by quotes):

    "Task list"

## I have 3 task list notes (Work, Home, and Big Projects)

Enable the checkboxes option. For "Only notes matching..", enter the
word `any:` followed by the names of the notes:

    any: Work Home "Big Projects"

If the 3 are all in a single notebook (with no other notes), the name of
the notebook can be used instead. For example:

    notebook:"Task lists"

Alternatively, if the 3 notes all share a common tag, the tag can be
used instead of a. For example:

    tag:todos

## I have 20 individual notes, one for each project

Enable the individual notes option. For "Only notes matching..", enter a
notebook, note name, or tag which matches the notes. For example:

    notebook:"Stuff to do"

Or if they're either tagged with `projects` or contain the word `task`
in the note label, match either:

    any: tag:projects task

Taco will match the same notes that evernote.com returns for this
search.

## I use both

Enable both options and follow the instructions above to choose a search
to find the notes you use for each. Taco will retrieve both.

has a detailed description of all Evernote search features, which should
all be supported by Taco.
