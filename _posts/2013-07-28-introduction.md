## What and why?

Taco helps you intentionally choose, confidently focus on, and
efficiently finish the tasks you already have. Taco brings all of the
tasks you have – from the services you already use – on to one screen.

Learn more on Taco's [Kickstarter listing](https://tacoapp.com/kickstarter)
(and video), our too-short-to-be-a-manifesto [manifesto](https://tacoapp.com/info/about),
or Leo Babauta on [The Daily Checklist](http://zenhabits.net/check/).

## Connectors

Taco works by interfacing with the task lists you already use. The world
doesn't need another way to create tasks, which is why you can't create
tasks in Taco.

Link the services you use and love by clicking the "Connectors" icon. On
[Connectors](https://tacoapp.com/connectors), choose a service. You'll
either be prompted to approve Taco's access (for services which support
OAuth) or be prompted for access information (such as an API key).

See the "Connectors" sidebar section for screenshots and details about
each connector's sync behavior.

## The Basics

Here's what Taco does.

### Drag and drop ("I'm ready to work on this now")

### Sync

### Hide ("I can't act on this")

Often other people set priorities for us, or there's simply items you
can't actually make progress on right now (but aren't able to remove). 
Click "Hide" to remove them from the Taco's typical view. You can see
hidden tasks by clicking the "Toggle Hidden Tasks" menu icon.

### Top ("On my radar")

Just learn information which made a task much more important than it
was? Click "Top" to move it to the top of "Up next."

### Print

Create a PDF with all tasks, like to print, save, or email it.

### Email

Send yourself an email containing "Up next" items (like the daily punchlist).

### Settings

Edit [Settings](https://tacoapp.com/connector), including connectors,
email summary frequency, and themes.

#### Themes

We want Taco to be an environment you love to work in (or better, many
such environments). To that end, Taco provides a handful of custom
backgrounds as themes. Choose one or provide your own.

As an advanced option, you can provide your own background image or
color. To provide a background image, add `?background=` and the URL to
the image. For example:

    https://tacoapp.com/tasks?background=http://the.url.com/wallpaper.png

[This URL](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?background=http://otife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/HD-wallpaper-Otife-abstract-tardis.jpg)
loads Taco with a different background. Images can live on any Web site,
such as these [free hosts](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+image+hosting)).

To provide a solid color instead of a background image, add `?bgcolor=`
and the 6-digit RGB ("HTML color") code, like `FF00FF`. For example:

    https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=22884F

To choose a color and find its 6-digit RGB code, try 
[Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/). Here are examples 
with [green](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=22884F), 
[orange](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=A64D00), and 
[blue](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=2A4580).

Once you've settled on a theme that you like, bookmark its URL to use it
on an ongoing basis. This may become easier.

#### Email Summary

Start the day out right with a punchlist of where you left off.  Taco
can email you what's up next every weekday, every day, or only on
Mondays. We'd put a joke about [work-life balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_balance#Consequences_of_an_Imbalance)
here if we had one.
