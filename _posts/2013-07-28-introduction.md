## What and why?

Taco helps you intentionally choose, confidently focus on, and
efficiently finish the tasks you already have. Taco brings all of the
tasks you have – from the services you already use – on to one screen.

Learn more on Taco's [Kickstarter listing](https://tacoapp.com/kickstarter)
(and video), our too-short-to-be-a-manifesto [manifesto](https://tacoapp.com/info/about),
or Leo Babauta on [The Daily Checklist](http://zenhabits.net/check/).


## Connectors

Taco works by interfacing with the task lists you already use. The world
doesn't need another way to create tasks, which is why you can't create
tasks in Taco.

Link the services you use and love by clicking the "Connectors" icon. On
[Connectors][], choose a service. You'll either be prompted to approve
Taco's access (for services which support OAuth) or be prompted for
access information (such as an API key).

When a connector is authorized, Taco will display a message like this
and will immediately try to obtain related tasks:

!["Connector activated. We're trying to retrieve tasks right now."]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/sync-message.png)

See the "Connectors" sidebar section for details about each connector's
sync behavior.
