# Status

This connector is beta and this setup document is in progress. If any
connector doesn't behave the way you expect, we always want to know, but
especially in this case.


# Setup

As of 2013-10-22, Cultured Code reported:

> we donâ€™t offer API access to Things Cloud, nor do we have any plans to
> do so at this time.

However, Taco can import tasks from Things via an exported file, like to
a network-accessible file sharing service such as
[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) or [Box](http://box.net/).

Things keeps the file updated locally and your file sharing service 
syncs those changes. When syncing, Taco downloads the file from your
file sharing service.

Setup is takes more steps and more effort. However, after the initial
setup, updates run automatically, so the end result is similar.

If Cultured Code does add an API, Taco will adopt it.

## Download export script

We'll use one of many existing [AppleScripts](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptx/concepts/work_with_as.html)
 to export Things tasks to a text file. We suggest 
[this one](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/wiki/ExportFromThingsToTaskPaper).
[Others](https://www.google.com/search?q=Things+TaskPaper+export)
are also available.

## Follow script instructions

Follow the setup instructions provided the script. For the recommended
script, double-click the `.scpt` file to edit it in the AppleScript
Editor.

Change the first line to a path to your file sharing service. For
example, change this line:

    set thePath to (path to desktop as Unicode text) & "ThingsToDo.txt"

to:

    set thePath to "/Users/bob/Dropbox/Public/things.taskpaper.txt"

This will write the file to the path above. The path should be one
which is synced with a file sharing service such as Dropbox.

## Save changes as application

Make your new AppleScript a runnable application instead of a script. In
AppleScript, choose `File` then `Export` (or if not shown, `Save As`).

For `File Format`, choose: `Application`.

## Run

From your Applications folder, invoke the AppleScript by double-clicking
it. The exported file should appear.

## Tell Taco

Visit Taco's Connectors page and click "Things." Provide the URL
(provided by your file sharing service) to the exported file above. For
example:

    https://dl.dropboxfilesharingexample.com/u123456/things.taskpaper.txt

When Taco syncs with connectors, it will think of this file as a
connector.

## Automate future updates

Install [cronnix](https://code.google.com/p/cronnix/) and add an entry
to run the export application every hour or as often as you see fit.

# Behavior

Taco imports all exported tasks.
