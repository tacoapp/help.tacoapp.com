To connect Bugzilla with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Bugzilla."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below.

All Bugzilla searches are automatically available via RSS. Taco uses
this functionality. In Bugzilla, perform a search for the issues which
you would like Taco to retain. For example, you might search for all
open issues which are assigned to you.

While looking at the search results page within Bugzilla, scroll to the
bottom of the page and look for a link labeled "Feed" or "RSS." It may
be the same page you are viewing, with `&ctype=atom` appended.

With that RSS feed URL, provide it to Taco:

![Sync Bugzilla issues via API]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/bugzilla/settings.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all bugs included in the Bugzilla search results.
