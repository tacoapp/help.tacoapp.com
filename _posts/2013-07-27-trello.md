# Setup

To connect Trello with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Trello."
Trello will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Trello tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/connectors/trello/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all cards which you have been added to, from across all
boards. This should match the "Cards" tab within Trello itself.
