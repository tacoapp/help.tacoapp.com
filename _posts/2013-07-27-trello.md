# Setup

To connect Trello with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Trello."
Trello will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Trello tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/trello/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all cards which you are subscribed to, from across all
boards. This matches the "Cards" tab within Trello itself.

**Adding yourself to a card**: View the card. The space bar Trello
keyboard shortcut (` `) will assign you to the card (without removing
any other members). Alternatively, in the right column, locate the
"Members" section:

![Add yourself to a Trello card]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/trello/add-member-to-card.png)

Click "Assign..." and choose your user. 

To add yourself while on a board view, expand the right-side menu. Under
"Members," locate your avatar. Click and drag your avatar onto the
card(s).
