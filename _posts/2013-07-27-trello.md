# Setup

To connect Trello with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Trello."
Trello will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Trello tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/trello/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all cards which you are a member of, from across all
boards. This matches the [Cards](https://trello.com/me/cards) tab within
Trello itself. Here's how Trello uses [card membership](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/1024320-adding-a-member-to-a-card).

**Adding yourself to a card**: View the card. The space bar Trello
keyboard [shortcut](https://trello.com/shortcuts) (` `) will assign you
to the card (without removing any other members). Alternatively, in the
right column, locate the "Members" section:

![Assigning yourself a Trello card]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/trello/add-member-to-card.png)

Click "Assign..." and choose your user per Trello's 
[user guide](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/1024320-adding-a-member-to-a-card).

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g tr` (as in "go to
Trello") to open Trello in a new browser tab.
