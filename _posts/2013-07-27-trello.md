# Setup

To connect Trello with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Trello."
Trello will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Trello tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/trello/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports either:

* all cards which you have been added to, which matches the 
[Cards](https://trello.com/me/cards) tab within Trello itself, or
* all active cards, regardless of ownership. To enable this, check 
**Retrieve all active cards (not only those which I'm assigned)**

Cards in a list named "Done," archived cards, and cards in closed 
boards are automatically ignored.

## Completion

When Taco notifies Trello that a card is completed, Taco moves
the card to a list on the same board named "Done".

If no list named Done exists on the board, Taco looks for any 
of the following common alternative list names: Complete, Completed, 
Finished, Closed.

If none of these list names exists on the board, no action is taken.

<a name="filters"></a>
## Filters

From within the cards above, Taco can further filter by board 
name(s), list name(s), and card label(s). Here are a few examples.

* Cards in 1 list (any board): `"Doing"`
* Cards in any of 3 lists (any board): `"Doing" OR "Some list name" OR "Critical tasks"`
* Cards in 1 list in 1 board: `"My Big Project" "Some list name"`
* Cards in either of 2 lists in 2 boards: `("My Big Project" "Critical tasks") OR ("My board" "Doing")`
* Cards in 2 boards (regardless of list), plus cards in 1 list in 1 board: `("My Big Project" OR "My board") OR ("Doing" "Another board")`

## How Trello uses card membership

If Taco is only syncing cards you own, here's how Trello uses 
[card membership](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/1024320-adding-a-member-to-a-card).

**Adding yourself to a card**: View the card. The space bar Trello
keyboard [shortcut](https://trello.com/shortcuts) (` `) will assign you
to the card (without removing any other members). Alternatively, in the
right column, locate the "Members" section:

![Assigning yourself a Trello card]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/trello/add-member-to-card.png)

Click "Assign..." and choose your user per Trello's 
[user guide](http://help.trello.com/customer/portal/articles/1024320-adding-a-member-to-a-card).

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g tr` (as in "go to
Trello") to open Trello in a new browser tab.
