# Setup

To connect Teamwork Project Manager (PM) with Taco, from the Connectors
page, click "TeamworkPM." Taco will present a settings page like the one
below. On the TeamworkPM "My Details" page, enable the API and obtain
your API token per [TeamworkPM Support](http://developer.teamworkpm.net/enabletheapiandgetyourkey).

Once you have the API key, provide it to Taco:

# Behavior

Taco imports all non-completed tasks which are assigned to you, from across all projects.
