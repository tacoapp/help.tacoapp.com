# Setup

To connect Redmine with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Redmine."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Obtain an API key
from your Redmine "My Profile" page or the right column of the standard
page layout (see [Redmine Support](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api#Authentication)).

Once you have the API key, provide it to Taco:

![Sync Redmine issues via API]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/redmine/settings.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports open issues which are assigned to you.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g re` (as in "go to
Redmine") to open Redmine in a new browser tab.
