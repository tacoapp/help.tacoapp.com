# Setup

To connect Basecamp Classic with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Basecamp." Basecamp will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Basecamp tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/basecamp/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all active todos which are assigned to you, from across all
todo lists.

Basecamp Next is coming soon.
