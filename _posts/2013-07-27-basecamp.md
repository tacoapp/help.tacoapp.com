# Setup

This page refers to Basecamp (also called "Basecamp Next"). Also see
[Basecamp Classic](basecamp.html).

To connect Basecamp with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Basecamp." Basecamp will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Basecamp tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/basecamp/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all active todos which are assigned to you, from across all
todo lists.

Also see [Basecamp Classic](basecamp.html).

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g ba` (as in "go to
Basecamp") to open Basecamp in a new browser tab.
