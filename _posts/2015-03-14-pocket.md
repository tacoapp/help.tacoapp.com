All Pocket searches are automatically [available via RSS](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/482632-can-i-subscribe-to-my-list-via-rss-).
Taco uses this functionality.

To connect Pocket with Taco, follow the instructions on
[Can I subscribe to my list via RSS?](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/482632-can-i-subscribe-to-my-list-via-rss-) to find your Pocket RSS URL.

With the RSS URL, from Taco's [Connectors](https://tacoapp.com/connectors)
page, click "RSS." Edit the RSS URL slightly to add your username and
password, like this:

    https://pocketusername:pocketpassword@getpocket.com/the/url

Replace `pocketusername` and `pocketpassword` with your Pocket
username and password. Leave the portion after `getpocket.com`
exactly as provided by Pocket.

Paste that URL into Taco's RSS connector.
