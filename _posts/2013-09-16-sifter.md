# Setup

To connect Sifter with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Sifter."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Obtain an API key
from your Sifter "My Profile" page per [Sifter Support](https://sifterapp.com/developer/start).

Once you have the API key, provide it to Taco:

# Behavior

Taco imports up to 100 discussions which are open or re-opened
([statuses](https://sifterapp.com/developer/resources/statuses)) and
assigned to you, from across all projects.
