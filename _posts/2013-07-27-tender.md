# Setup

To connect Tender with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Tender."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Obtain an API key
from your Tender "Edit Profile" page per [Tender Support](http://help.tenderapp.com/kb/api/authentication)).

Note: Look for the "API Keys" section, not your "External User ID." Taco
uses the JSON API key, shown first here:

![Tender API Keys]({{ site.url }}/asset/images/connectors/tender/api-key.png)

Once you have the JSON API key, provide it to Taco:

![Sync Tender issues via API]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/tender/settings.png)
