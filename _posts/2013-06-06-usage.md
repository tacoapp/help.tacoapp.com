The template follows a very simple convention of defining categories that correspond to sections in the navigation. Here are the default ones (they are listed in the `_config.yml`):

- `doc` - Documentation 
- `ref` - Reference
- `tut` - Tutorial
- `dev` - Developers
- `post` - Posts

Since Jekyll is more geared towards blog posts, specifiying a date and setting up the front-matter can get tedious. Supplied in the `bin` directory is a simple Ruby scripy for creating a new _page_:

```bash
ruby bin/jekyll-page title category [filename] [--edit]
```

where `title` is the title of page, `category` is one of the categories defined in the `_config.yml`. By default the `filename` will be derived from the `title`, but you can specify an explicit filename (without the date) by passing the third agument. Finally the `--edit` (or just `-e`) will launch the editor defined by the `$EDITOR` environment variable.

#### Example

```bash
./bin/jekyll-page "My New Page" ref
```

Will produce a file `_posts/2013-06-05-my-new-page.md` with the [Front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) already defined:

```html

layout: page
title: "My New Page"

```
