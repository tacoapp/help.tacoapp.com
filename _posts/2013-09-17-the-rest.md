### Add your own links, logos, content, and iframes

Taco can show links, logos/images, text, and even embedded dynamic
content from IFRAMEs (such as your [Google Calendar](../connectors/google.html#calendar)).
[Here's more](http://blog.tacoapp.com/post/102483344569/a-more-welcoming-taco).

To provide custom content, visit [Theme](https://tacoapp.com/theme#content) in
"Add your own logo, links, and content." You'll find examples there. Here's
a custom logo:

![Custom logo markdown]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/custom-header-example.jpg)

Here's showing an image or icon as a link to `example.com`.

```
[ ![](http://example.com/logo.png) ](http://example.com)
```

Taco automatically centers the content, so more than one of these blocks
can be used side by side ([like this](https://twitter.com/tacoapp/status/557594168516562945)).

### Find-as-you-type search

To see only a portion of "For later" tasks, click the magnifying glass
or press `/` (forward slash), then type part of a task label, a service
name, or a service and a certain type of its tasks. Here's how it looks:

![Find as you type 1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-1.jpg)
![Find as you type 2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-2.jpg)
![Find as you type 3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-3.jpg)

#### Pinning search results

To continue using Taco while the find-as-you-type filter remains active,
click outside of the search box or press Enter. This is great if you're
working on a specific project or type of work.

To remove the find-as-you-type filter, press click the "X" icon or press
Escape.

#### Searching for a service, project, or status

![Find as you type - project]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-project.png)

In addition to searching for the task label, Taco can show tasks from:

* a service, like Basecamp (search for `basecamp`) or Google (`google`)
* a service and project, like a project named "World Domination" on Teamwork
(`teamwork:world domination`) or a board named "Roadmap" on Trello
(`trello:roadmap`).
* a service and type of task, like flagged OmniFocus tasks
(`omnifocus:flagged`) or GitHub Issues which have the label "design"
(`github:design`).

To save typing, searches can be shortened. For example, `basecamp:acme
consulting engagement` can be shortened to `bas:acm` (or a longer
equivalent, like `base:acme`). Type 3 or more letters.

#### Examples

To explore possible attributes for find-as-you-type searches, hover over
a task. Any information shown which may apply to multiple tasks is
usable in a search. For example, if hovering shows "Status: unstarted"
on a Pivotal Tracker story, typing `pivotal:unstarted` will show that
story and other unstarted stories.

![Find as you type - project]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-project.png)

Here's some examples and ideas to get started with:

    asana:inbox
    asana:today
    basecamp:big project
    google:google tasks list name
    github:repo or repo owner name
    github:issue label
    highrise:overdue
    omnifocus:inbox
    omnifocus:flagged
    pivotal:started
    todoist:my personal project
    todoist:label
    trello:board name
    trello:doing


### Keyboard shortcuts

Taco has 2 types of keyboard shortcuts:

* To search, press `/`. Tasks will be filtered as you type. To leave the
search active, just click outside of the search box or press enter. To
remove the search, press escape.

* To open a connected service in a new brower tab, press `g` then 2
letters from a connected service's name (usually the first 2). For
example, `ggo` will open Google, `gba` will open Basecamp, and `gtr`
will open Trello, if those services are connected.

Unsure of a connector's shortcut? Check its doc page.

### Mobile access

Taco's Web site is functional on most mobile devices. Simply visit Taco
and add it to your home screen or bookmark it.

Here's how Taco looks when added to the home screen on iOS:

### Filters

For most connectors, you can instantly show different tasks based on
project, task list, statuses, due date, and other attributes.

On Taco's task list, **click the magnifying glass/search icon** and choose:

![Sidebar project/date selector]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/sidebar-project-date-selector.png)

Taco remembers the last-used settings when you visit again on the same
device.

Each connector has certain task attributes which can be used as filters.
The available attributes are listed on its settings page. They often
include a project name, task labels/tags, due date, or service-specific
scheduling attributes (like `soon`).

#### Excluding tasks

Taco can also completely exclude (ignore) certain tasks or only
retrieve a limited set, such as the 5 highest priority.

We recommend retrieving all tasks, though, since Taco makes it practical
to consider everything.

To exclude tasks, once a connector is active, visit [Connectors][],
scroll to the connector, and click its "Settings" link. On connectors
with filter support, an "Exclude Tasks" section will be shown similar
to this:

![Exclude tasks]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/filters.png)

At its simplest, just choose the desired behavior (include or exclude)
and then check off those attributes which Taco should include or
exclude.

For more complex needs, like combinations of attributes, Taco's
filters work similar to
[Google searches](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/136861?p=adv_operators&hl=en).

##### Exclusion Examples

To ignore tasks from 2 Basecamp projects, click "All except those I
specify below" and click the checkboxes by the 2 projects.

Taco will generate an exclusion config like
`"My Big Project" OR "Another Project"` for you.

Alternatively, to only retrieve one project, click "Only those I specify
below" and click the checkbox by the project. Taco will generate an
exclusion like `"My Big Project"` for you.

Or using OmniFocus, to only retrieve tasks in the Inbox, the "Design
planning" project, or the "Phone calls" context, click "Only those I
specify below" and click those. The resulting exclusion might be
`Inbox OR "Design planning" OR "Phone calls"`.

For advanced users: when editing the exclusion string, note that as with
Google, the `OR` must be capitalized. Task matching is case-insensitive.

Not sure? Just let us know what you want to sync and we'll provide an
example.


### Multiple accounts on a service

To link multiple accounts on the same service, or the same account with
different task filter settings, visit [Connectors][]. Navigate to the
service and click "Link another account":

!["Link another account"]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/second-account.png)

Note: Different services may have restrictions on multiple
authorizations. Please let us know if the result is not exactly the set
of tasks which you want.


### App Icon

For users of [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) and other
[site-specific browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser#Software),
Taco includes the `fluid-icon` HTML tag to enable Fluid to automatically
discover a high-resolution icon. The icon is also available
[here]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/taco-icon-500x500.png) (500x500).

Here's an example of task switching to Fluid in Mac OS X:

![OS X icon]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/fluid-icon.png)


### Other Formats

In addition to the print (PDF) link within Taco, the task list is also
available as a [text file](https://tacoapp.com/tasks.txt), an
[OPML file](https://tacoapp.com/tasks.opml) (such as to use in a
mind-mapping app), and an [Atom/RSS feed](https://tacoapp.com/tasks.atom).

### Automatic refresh

Taco refreshes hourly for about 3 hours after you last used taco and
daily while you're at least an occasional user. To tell Taco to refresh
immediately, click the left-most menu icon ("Refresh tasks").
