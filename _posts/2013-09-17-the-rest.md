## The Rest

Advanced-y options for advanced-y people.


### Keyboard shortcuts

Taco has 2 types of keyboard shortcuts:

* To search, press `/`. Tasks will be filtered as you type. To leave the
search active, just click outside of the search box or press enter. To
remove the search, press escape.

* To open a connected service in a new brower tab, press `g` then 2
letters from the connected service's name (usually the first 2). For
example, `g go` will open Google, `g ba` will open Basecamp, and `g tr`
will open Trello. (Unsure of a connector's shortcut? Check its doc
page.)


### Mobile access

Taco's Web site is functional on most mobile devices. Simply visit Taco
and add it to your home screen or bookmark it.

Here's how Taco looks when added to the home screen on iOS:

### Filters

For all connectors, Taco can filter tasks to only those matching (or not
matching) words or phrases you want, or only retrieve a limited set
(such as the 5 highest priority).

Once a connector is active, visit [Connectors][] and click "Settings". 
Click "Filters (Optional)" to expand the filter settings, if it is not
already visible. You should see this:

![Filter tasks]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/filters.png)

Taco's filters work similar to 
[Google searches](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/136861?p=adv_operators&hl=en).
For example, a simple filter to ignore tasks containing "Not important" would be:

    -"Not important"

A filter to only retrieve tasks containing either "Automate" or "for
users" would be:

    automate OR "for users"

Note that as with Google, the `OR` must be capitalized. Task matching is
case-insensitive.


### Multiple accounts on a service

To link multiple accounts on the same service, or the same account with
different task filter settings, visit [Connectors][]. Navigate to the
service and click "Add Another":

!["Add Another"]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/add-another.png)

Note: Different services may have restrictions on multiple
authorizations. Please let us know if the result is not exactly the set
of tasks which you want.


### App Icon

For users of [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) and other 
[site-specific browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser#Software),
Taco includes the `fluid-icon` HTML tag to enable Fluid to automatically
discover a high-resolution icon. The icon is also available 
[here]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/taco-icon-500x500.png) (500x500).

Here's an example of task switching to Fluid in Mac OS X:

### Non-Features

#### Automatic refresh

Taco doesn't automatically refresh at all. That decision began as a way
to be considerate of Google Tasks' API request limit, but after adding
additional services, we tried auto-syncing with other services. The
surprise: Troy really didn't care for tasks shifting underneath him.

Though an automatic refresh sounded really useful, trying it made Troy
realize that the unique thing about Taco is that it's entirely my own
preferences, decoupled from any others. Taco's stable, all-about-me
priority was my escape valve from other people's changes: I know nothing
will move unless I do it.

(Tangent: completing a task fell into the same "I thought I'd want it"
bucket. Turned out that visiting the underlying service to click "Close"
feels like a golf ball going into a hole - not something golfers think
of as a distraction! Usually there's task-specific notes to add anyway.)
