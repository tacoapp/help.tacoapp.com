# Setup

To connect Google Tasks with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Google Tasks." GitHub will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google-tasks/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all Google Tasks from across all lists.

Note that Taco has as little access as possible in order to see Tasks.
Taco can only see Tasks, not any other data in your Google Account.
