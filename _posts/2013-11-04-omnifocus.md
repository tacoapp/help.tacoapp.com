with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "OmniFocus." Taco will
present a settings page like the one below. Provide your Omni Sync
Server credentials.

# Behavior

Taco imports all open tasks from across all contexts.

## Links

Clicking a task label will view the task in OmniFocus locally.
OmniFocus will be started if it is not already running.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g of` (as in "go to
OmniFocus") to open OmniFocus on your desktop. The "Inbox" perspective
will be shown.
