# Setup

To connect OmniFocus (via [Omni Sync Server](http://www.omnigroup.com/support/omnifocus-omni-sync-server))
with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "OmniFocus." Taco will
present a settings page like the one below. Provide your Omni Sync
Server credentials.

# Behavior

Taco imports all open tasks from across all contexts. For more granular
control, consider [filters](../how-it-works/the-rest.html#filters) or a
automated hourly export, as Taco supports for [Things](things.html) and
[text files](text-file.html).

## Links

Clicking a task label will view the task in OmniFocus locally.
OmniFocus will be started if it is not already running.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g of` (as in "go to
OmniFocus") to open OmniFocus on your desktop. The "Inbox" perspective
will be shown.
