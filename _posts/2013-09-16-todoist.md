# Setup

To connect Todoist with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Todoist."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Obtain a Todoist API
token from Todoist's [Account Settings page](https://todoist.com/Users/viewPrefs?page=account)
(under the "Account" tab).

Once you have the API key, provide it to Taco:

![Sync Todoist issues via API]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/todoist/settings.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all [un-completed](https://todoist.com/API/help#items)
tasks from across all un-archived projects.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g to` (as in "go to
Todoist") to open Todoist in a new browser tab.
