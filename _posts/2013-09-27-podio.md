# Setup

To connect Podio with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Podio." Podio will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Podio tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/podio/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports up to 100 [tasks](https://help.podio.com/entries/21696306-Filtering-tasks)
which are assigned to you and are not completed, from across all
workspaces.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g po` (as in "go to
Podio") to open Podio in a new browser tab.
