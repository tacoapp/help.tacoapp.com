# Status

This connector is beta. If any connector doesn't behave the way you
expect, we always want to know, but especially in this case.

# Setup

To connect Exchange (via 
[Exchange Web Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd877045.aspx) or EWS)
with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Exchange." Taco will
present a settings page like the one below. Provide your Exchange
server hostname (such as `mail.example.com` or `ex01.example.com`),
username, and password.

## Requirements

Taco requires Exchange Web Services (EWS) enabled on the Exchange
server. EWS is different from the better-known Outlook Web Access (OWA),
which is used as webmail. EWS exposes an API at `/EWS/Exchange.asmx`.

Feel free to email us if we can help or see whether your server is
suitable.

### Rackspace (emailsrvr.com)

Taco works with Rackspace Exchange hosting (emailsrvr.com). To find the
name of your system, visit Rackspace's [control panel](https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp).
In the Client Setup section, click the Entourage 2008 link.

Look for "EWS Server." It should be a name similar to
`mex01.emailsrvr.com`. Provide that Exchange server name in Taco's
Exchange settings.

# Behavior

Taco imports all open tasks.
