# Status

This connector is beta. If any connector doesn't behave the way you
expect, we always want to know, but especially in this case.

# Setup

To connect Exchange (via 
[Exchange Web Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd877045(v=exchg.140).aspx) or EWS)
with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Exchange." Taco will
present a settings page like the one below. Provide your Exchange
server hostname (such as `mail.example.com` or ex01.example.com`),
username, and password.

## Requirements

Taco requires Exchange Web Services (EWS) enabled on the Exchange
server. EWS is different from the better-known Outlook Web Access (OWA),
which is used as webmail. EWS exposes an API at `/EWS/Exchange.asmx`.

Feel free to email us if we can help or see whether your server is
suitable.

# Behavior

Taco imports all open tasks.
