# Setup

To have Taco consider a text file as a list of tasks, from the
Connectors page, click "Text File." Provide an URL to the text file
containing your tasks.

Many applications can be configured to export tasks to a text file,
a process which can be easily automated.

In other cases, a text file may be the primary task list itself (for
example, with [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper)).

## Format

The text file should contain one task per line. Lines beginning with `#`
(a pound sign) are ignored as comments.

That's it.

<a name="taskpaper"></a>
### TaskPaper (optional)

If the URL contains `taskpaper` or ends in `.tp`, Taco will consider the
file to be in TaskPaper format. Taco will only consider lines beginning
with `- ` (and will remove that from the label) and will ignore tasks 
tagged with `@done`.
