# Setup

To have Taco consider a text file as a list of tasks, from the
Connectors page, click "Text File." Provide an URL to the text file
containing your tasks.

Many applications can be configured to export tasks to a text file,
a process which can be easily automated.

In other cases, a text file may be the primary task list itself (for
example, with [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper)).

## Format

The text file should contain one task per line. Lines beginning with `#`
(a pound sign) are ignored as comments.

That's it.

### TaskPaper (optional)

If the filename contains `taskpaper`, Taco will consider the file to be
in TaskPaper format. Taco will only consider lines beginning with `- `
and will ignore those tagged with `@done`.
