# Setup

To connect Asana with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Asana."
Asana will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Asana tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/asana/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all unarchived, in-progress tasks which are assigned to
you, from across all workspaces. "In-progress" means all tasks which
have not been marked completed. Tasks ending with a colon (`:`) are
ignored as priority headings (see [Asana Guide](http://asana.com/guide/videos/bug-tracking)).
