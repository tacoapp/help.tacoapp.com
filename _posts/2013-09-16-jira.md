# Setup

To connect JIRA with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "JIRA."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Provide your
JIRA account credentials to Taco in the settings below.

Note: We don't like having account credentials. JIRA does not have the
concept of an API token and enabling OAuth access requires
administrative privileges (as well as jumping through an impractical
number of hoops; [details](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+API+Example+-+Basic+Authentication)).
If JIRA supports an API token or simpler OAuth, Taco will attempt to use
it.

## Atlassian OnDemand with Google Apps SSO
<a name="atlassian-ondemand"></a>

When using `yoursite.atlassian.net` and authenticating with your Google
Apps account (rather than a JIRA account), Atlassian OnDemand still
creates a username and password.

This password is used for things like Subversion and private RSS feeds,
and can be found and changed within JIRA. That's the password which
Taco can use to retrieve your tickets, too.

Here's how to find your local ("Atlassian Cloud") password:

Not sure? Just email support@ or otherwise contact us.

# Behavior

Taco imports all unresolved issues, from across all projects.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g ji` (as in "go to
JIRA") to open JIRA in a new browser tab.
