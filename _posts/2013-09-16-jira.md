# Setup

To connect JIRA with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "JIRA."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Provide your
JIRA account credentials to Taco in the settings below.

Note: We don't like having account credentials. JIRA does not have the
concept of an API token and enabling OAuth access requires
administrative privileges (as well as jumping through an impractical
number of hoops; [details](https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+API+Example+-+Basic+Authentication)). 
If JIRA supports an API token or simpler OAuth, Taco will attempt to use
it.

# Behavior

Taco imports all unresolved issues, from across all projects.
