# Important change - December 2019

**Summary**: Starting in December 2019, Taco will only have access to Google Tasks, not Gmail messages. However, one can create a Google Task from a Gmail message in 2 clicks, without leaving Gmail's message view.

**The details**: Due to a [Google policy change](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/elevating-user-trust-in-our-api-ecosystems) ([analysis](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/google_gmail_developer/)), Google will terminate access to the Gmail API for Taco and many other services. Taco will no longer have access to the Gmail API beginning in late December, 2019.

**There's good news, though**: Google Tasks will still be supported and works well for Gmail emails. Here's the 2 clicks to create an email-specific task in Gmail:

When you want an email to appear in Taco, instead of starring the message, create a Google Task from it. Google Tasks is integrated into Gmail and Google Calendar. Also, official Google Tasks apps are available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-tasks-get-things-done/id1353634006) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks&hl=en_US), though they aren't at all required - all Tasks interaction can occur within Gmail. Taco will link directly to the original Gmail message.


# Setup

Taco can connect with Google [Tasks](https://mail.google.com/tasks/). Google Tasks can be created within Gmail - even from a specific Gmail message/thread - in 2 clicks:

![Create Google Task from Gmail message]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-tasks-screencast.gif)

When a Google Task is related to a Gmail message, Taco links directly to the Gmail message.

Taco can also embed your Google Calendar, as [described below](#calendar).

## Choose services

To connect Google Tasks (and indirectly, Gmail) with Taco, from the Connectors
page, click "Google." Google will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/oauth-tasks.png)

# Behavior

Taco imports all active Google Tasks from across all lists.
"Active" means the task has not been completed, deleted, or hidden.

Note that Taco has as little access as possible. Taco can only see Tasks and
does not have any direct access to Gmail nor the other data in your Google
account (such as Drive).

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g go` (as in "go to
Google") to open Google in a new browser tab.

## Multiple accounts

Taco can work with multiple Google accounts. To link more than one
account, visit [google.com](https://google.com/) and log out so that
Google prompts you which account to link. Then, visit
[Connectors](https://tacoapp.com/connectors) and link Google. Login as
the account you want to link. Repeat.

Note: Taco links to tasks by using the domain name of the related
account, like `gmail.com` (for Gmail) or `mycompany.com` (Google Apps).
This works well with one account per domain name, such as a work account
and a home account.

However, when you login to Google with multiple accounts on gmail.com,
Google chooses email URLs based on the order you logged in (in the
current browsing session). Taco's has no way to tell which account you
logged in to first (on google.com), so the links to gmail.com mails
assume that the gmail.com account linked with Taco was the first
gmail.com account you logged in to.

*Partial workaround*: Google interprets Taco's links using the first
account you logged in to Google as (in the current browsing session).
To control which Gmail account Taco links use, log out of both Google
accounts, then log in to the Google account that you want Taco links
to use. Make sure to log in to that account first in your browsing
session. This will at least let you choose which account's links do work.


# Google Calendar
<a name="calendar"></a>

Taco can display your Google Calendar, like a scrollable agenda:

![Google Calendar - agenda]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-example-agenda.png)

or a day, week, or month view:

![Google Calendar - month]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-example-month.png)

Here's how. Visit [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).
Click the cog icon (upper right), choose Settings from the dropdown, then
click the Calendars tab. You'll arrive [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?pli=1#i).

Click the name of one of the calendars, like the calendar named
"Sally Diaz" shown here:

![Google Calendar - Settings - Calendars]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-settings-calendars.png)

Scroll to "Embed this calendar." Click the "Customize the color, size,
and other options" link, as shown here:

![Google Calendar - Settings - Calendars - Embed]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-embed-link.png)

Choose which calendar(s) to include, the format, and size. Here is one
popular set of options:

![Embed Google Calendar in Taco Chrome extension]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-example-settings.png)

When finished adjusting calendar settings, click the "Update HTML"
button. Highlight the HTML shown and copy it. Browse to
[Taco Theme settings](https://tacoapp.com/theme#content) under
"Add your own logo, links, and content." Paste the HTML (with no
other changes), like this:

![Embed Google Calendar agenda HTML in Taco]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-theme-html.png)

Save the Taco settings and reload the page once or twice. You will need
to be logged in to Google with access to your calendar in order to see
it. To read more about Google Calendar's embed functionality, see
