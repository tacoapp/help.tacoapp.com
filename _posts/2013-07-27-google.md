# Setup

Taco can connect with Google [Tasks](https://mail.google.com/tasks/) and/or Gmail (any label, such as `Inbox`, `Starred`, or your own custom folder/label).

Taco can also embed your Google Calendar, as [described below](#calendar).

## Choose services

To connect Google Tasks and/or Gmail with Taco, from the Connectors
page, click "Google." You'll see a page to choose services:

![Choose Gmail, Tasks, or both]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/choose_services.png)

Enable both or either service and click "Connect Google Services."

## Requirements

In Gmail, the desired label must be accessible via IMAP. The `Inbox`
and `Starred` labels are both accessable by default.

If you have disabled IMAP access to the label which Taco is using,
or have disabled all IMAP access, visit Gmail Settings. On the
[Forwarding and POP/IMAP](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/fwdandpop) tab,
enable IMAP Access and click Save Changes. Then, on the [Labels](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/labels)
tab, enable IMAP access to the label you provided to Taco.

On [Forwarding and POP/IMAP](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/fwdandpop), click **Enable IMAP**:

![Gmail IMAP access]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/imap.png)

On [Labels](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/labels), enable **"Show in IMAP"** for desired label. It should look like this:

![Gmail Labels (Starred) IMAP access]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-imap.png)

### IMAP connection limit

Gmail limits each email account to 15 concurrent IMAP connections
([details](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/97150?hl=en)).
While this is rarely a problem, users with many active email clients
(for example, many computers and mobile devices) may occasionally see
a message like this in Taco:

> Gmail is temporarily not accepting connections for your account
> due to Google's IMAP connection limit. This is not a problem;
> Taco will sync again when Gmail permits.

This limit is not caused by Taco and is nothing to worry about.
Taco automatically works around this restriction, as do other email
(IMAP) clients.


## Authorize access

Google will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/oauth-tasks.png)

When both Tasks and Gmail are enabled, the authorization page will look
like this.

**Google+ access**: Taco does not need, want, or use Google+ in any way.
The message "Know who you are on Google+" below is inaccurate, as
detailed in [this comment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18329629/scope-to-get-email-address-alone#comment27077806_18343883). We're hopeful that Google will fix this problem,
but regardless, Taco does not use or request data from Google+.

![Sync Gmail starred emails and Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/oauth-gmail-tasks.png)

### Multiple accounts

Taco can work with multiple Gmail accounts. To link more than one
account, visit [google.com](https://google.com/) and log out so that
Google prompts you which account to link. Then, visit
[Connectors](https://tacoapp.com/connectors) and link Google. Login as
the account you want to link. Repeat.

Note: Taco links to tasks by using the domain name of the related
account, like `gmail.com` (for Gmail) or `mycompany.com` (Google Apps).
This works well with one account per domain name, such as a work account
and a home account.

However, when you login to Google with multiple accounts on gmail.com,
Google chooses email URLs based on the order you logged in (in the
current browsing session). Taco's has no way to tell which account you
logged in to first (on google.com), so the links to gmail.com mails
assume that the gmail.com account linked with Taco was the first
gmail.com account you logged in to.

# Behavior

Tasks: Taco imports all active Google Tasks from across all lists.
"Active" means the task has not been completed, deleted, or hidden.

Gmail: Taco imports all threads from the label you provided.

Note that Taco has as little access as possible in order to see Tasks,
Gmail, or both. Taco can only see Tasks, Gmail, or both, not any other
data in your Google account, and no logic exists within Taco to access
any other data.

For Gmail threads, Taco links to the specific message (Chrome) or the
folder (Safari). For Google Tasks items, Taco links to the standalone
Google Tasks [view](https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas).

### Using Mailbox.app, Sunrise, or another task-oriented email program?

Taco can work with the Gmail labels generated by most other Gmail-oriented
email programs. For example, for Mailbox.app, provide Taco with the label:

    [Mailbox]/To Do

Taco will then show threads with that label, which are all threads you
designate as To Do in Mailbox.app.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g go` (as in "go to
Google") to open Google in a new browser tab.


# Tips

<a name="calendar"></a>
## Google Calendar

Taco can display your Google Calendar, like a scrollable agenda:

![Google Calendar - agenda]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-example-agenda.png)

or a day, week, or month view:

![Google Calendar - month]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-example-month.png)

Here's how. Visit [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar).
Click the cog icon (upper right), choose Settings from the dropdown, then
click the Calendars tab. You'll arrive [here](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?pli=1#i).

Click the name of one of the calendars, like the calendar named
"Sally Diaz" shown here:

![Google Calendar - Settings - Calendars]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-settings-calendars.png)

Scroll to "Embed this calendar." Click the "Customize the color, size,
and other options" link, as shown here:

![Google Calendar - Settings - Calendars - Embed]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-embed-link.png)

Choose which calendar(s) to include, the format, and size. Here is one
popular set of options:

![Embed Google Calendar in Taco Chrome extension]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-example-settings.png)

When finished adjusting calendar settings, click the "Update HTML"
button. Highlight the HTML shown and copy it. Browse to
[Taco Theme settings](https://tacoapp.com/theme#content) under
"Add your own logo, links, and content." Paste the HTML (with no
other changes), like this:

![Embed Google Calendar agenda HTML in Taco]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/google-calendar-theme-html.png)

Save the Taco settings and reload the page once or twice. You will need
to be logged in to Google with access to your calendar in order to see
it.

## Un-starring emails

If you would like to use Gmail's `Starred` folder/label and had
previously used starred emails without ever un-starring them,
here's a quick way to un-star existing emails and start fresh:

### 1. Show starred emails

Visit [all starred emails](https://mail.google.com/mail/#starred) in Gmail:

![Show starred emails in Gmail]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-select-all.png)

### 2. Select all starred emails

Choose Select -> All. If you have more than 1 screenful of starred
messages, Gmail will then show "Select all conversations" link at the
top of the message list. Click it.

![Show all starred emails in Gmail]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-select-all-more.png)

### 3. Un-star emails

With all starred messages checked, click the "More" dropdown and choose
"Remove star."

![Remove star]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-remove-star.png)

After stars have been removed from old emails, simply star any new
emails which need action. When an email is no longer a task, un-star
it from within Taco or Gmail.
