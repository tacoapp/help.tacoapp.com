# Setup

Taco can connect with Google [Tasks](https://mail.google.com/tasks/) and/or Gmail ([starred emails](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/5904?hl=en)).

## Choose services

To connect Google Tasks and/or Gmail with Taco, from the Connectors
page, click "Google." You'll see a page to choose services:

![Choose Gmail, Tasks, or both]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/choose_services.png)

Enable both or either service and click "Connect Google Services."

## Requirements

In Gmail, the "Starred" label must be accessible via IMAP. It is
accessable by default.

If you have disabled IMAP access to this label, go to Gmail
[Settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/labels). On the
"Labels" tab, enable IMAP access to the "Starred" folder:

![Gmail Labels (Starred) IMAP access]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-imap.png)

## Authorize access

Google will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/oauth-tasks.png)

When both Tasks and Gmail are enabled, the authorization page will look
like this.

**Google+ access**: Taco does not need, want, or use Google+ in any way.
The message "Know who you are on Google+" below is inaccurate, as
detailed in [this comment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18329629/scope-to-get-email-address-alone#comment27077806_18343883). We're hopeful that Google will fix this problem,
but regardless, Taco does not use or request data from Google+.

# Behavior

Tasks: Taco imports all active Google Tasks from across all lists.
"Active" means the task has not been completed, deleted, or hidden.

Gmail: Taco imports all starred threads.

Note that Taco has as little access as possible in order to see Tasks,
Gmail, or both. Taco can only see Tasks, Gmail, or both, not any other
data in your Google account, and no logic exists within Taco to access
any other data.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g go` (as in "go to
Google") to open Google in a new browser tab.

## Un-starring emails

If you previously used starred emails without ever un-starring them,
here's a quick way to un-star existing emails and start fresh:

1. Visit [all starred emails](https://mail.google.com/mail/#starred) in Gmail:
![Show starred emails in Gmail]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-select-all.png)
2. Choose Select -> All. If you have more than 1 screenful of starred
messages, Gmail will then show "Select all conversations" link at the
top of the message list. Click it.
![Show all starred emails in Gmail]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-select-all-more.png)
3. With all starred messages checked, click the "More" dropdown and choose "Remove star."
![Remove star]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/gmail-starred-remove-star.png)

After stars have been removed from old emails, simply star any new
emails which need action. Once the action is complete, un-star them from
within Taco or Gmail.
