# Setup

Taco can connect with Google [Tasks](https://mail.google.com/tasks/) and/or GMail ([starred emails](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/5904?hl=en)).

## Choose services

To connect Google Tasks and/or GMail with Taco, from the Connectors
page, click "Google." You'll see a page to choose services:

![Choose GMail, Tasks, or both]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/choose_services.png)

Enable both or either service and click "Connect Google Services."

## Authorize access

Google will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/oauth-tasks.png)

When both Tasks and GMail are enabled, the authorization page will look
like this. Note: Taco does not need, want, or use Google+ in any way.
The message "Know who you are on Google+" message is inaccurate, as
detailed in this [comment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18329629/scope-to-get-email-address-alone#comment27077806_18343883).
As soon as Google offers a fix for this problem, Taco will use it.

![Sync GMail starred emails and Google Tasks tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/google/oauth-gmail-tasks.png)

# Behavior

Taco imports all Google Tasks from across all lists.

Note that Taco has as little access as possible in order to see Tasks.
Taco can only see Tasks, not any other data in your Google Account.
