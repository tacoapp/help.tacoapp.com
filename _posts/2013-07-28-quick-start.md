On Taco's [Connectors][] page, link the services you use and love.
Takes about 10 seconds.

### How's this work?

Choose a service. You'll either be prompted to approve Taco's access or
be prompted for access information (such as an API key).

When a connector is authorized, Taco will display a message like this
and then fetch your tasks:

!["Connector activated. We're trying to retrieve tasks right now."]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/sync-message.png)

Many connectors can filter tasks too, like to only retrieve certain
projects. For details, see each connector's help page or [Filters][].


## Using Taco

### Ready to work? Just drag & drop

Just click a task and drag it from For Later to Up Next, or vice versa.
It's that simple.

### Updating tasks: Sync

Click the Sync icon to tell Taco to update its data from your connected
services. In 10-15 seconds, you'll see the updated information roll in.
Taco retrieves up to 500 tasks from each connected service.

### Top

Did one task suddenly become much more important than it was? Click
"Top" to move it to the top of "Up next."

### Can't act on something? Hide it

Often other people set priorities for us, or there's simply items you
can't actually make progress on right now (but aren't able to remove). 
Click "Hide" to remove them from the Taco's typical view. You can see
hidden tasks by clicking the "Toggle Hidden Tasks" menu icon.

### Print

Create a PDF with all tasks, like to print, save, or email it.

### Email

Send yourself an email containing "Up next" items (like the daily
punchlist). Taco can also do this on a daily basis.

### Focus! Hide the sidebar

Want to focus? To hide the "For Later" sidebar entirely, hit `\`
(backslash) or click the arrow at the far left edge of the screen. To
display "For Later" again, do the same thing.

Taco remembers your last-used option on any given browser, so it won't
interrupt your focus mode.


## Settings

Visit [Settings](https://tacoapp.com/connector) to add connectors or
change preferences.

### Email summary

Start the day out right with a punchlist of where you left off.  Taco
can email you what's up next every weekday, every day, or only on
Mondays. We'd put a joke about [work-life balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_balance#Consequences_of_an_Imbalance)
here if we had one.

### Themes

We want Taco to be an environment you love to work in (or better, many
such environments). To that end, Taco provides a handful of custom
backgrounds as themes. Choose one or provide your own.

To provide your own image, provide a URL. To choose a solid color
instead of an image, provide a Web (RGB) color code. To choose a color,
try [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/). 

To disable distinctive backgrounds entirely, provide a neutral color
like [gray](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=444444).
