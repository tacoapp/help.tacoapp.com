# Setup

To connect Highrise with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Highrise." Highrise will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Highrise tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/highrise/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports all upcoming tasks which are assigned to you. Because
Highrise often has many identically-worded tasks (where one task needs
to happen for many different counterparties), Taco appends the related
party to the description. Typically this is the prospect's name.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g hi` (as in "go to
Highrise") to open Highrise in a new browser tab.
