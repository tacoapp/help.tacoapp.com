# Setup

To connect Zendesk with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Zendesk."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below. Obtain a
read-only API key per [Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/entries/21733618-api-key).

# Behavior

By default, Taco imports all tickets which match this filter:

    assignee:me status<solved order_by:priority sort:desc

This filter is appropriate for most Zendesk environments. You may also
define your own filter, as shown in the screenshot above. See
[Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/entries/20239737).
