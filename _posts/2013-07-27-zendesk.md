# Setup

To connect Zendesk with Taco, from the Connectors page, click "Zendesk."
Taco will present a settings page like the one below.

## API token

Obtain a Zendesk API token in Zendesk under Settings > Channels > API, per
[Zendesk API docs](http://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/rest_api/introduction.html#security-and-authentication).

# Behavior

By default, Taco imports all tickets which match this filter:

    assignee:me status<solved order_by:priority sort:desc

This filter is appropriate for most Zendesk environments. You may also
define your own filter, as shown in the screenshot above. See
[Zendesk Support](https://support.zendesk.com/entries/20239737).

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g ze` (as in "go to
Zendesk") to open Zendesk in a new browser tab.
