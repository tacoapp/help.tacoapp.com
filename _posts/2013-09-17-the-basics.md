## The Basics

Here's how to use Taco.

**Important**: Like Taco itself, this document is evolving and includes
freeform notes.

### Drag and drop ("I'm ready to work on this now")

Just click a task and drag it from For Later to Up Next, or vice versa.
It's that simple.

### Sync

Click the Sync icon to tell Taco to update its data from your connected
services. In 12-15 seconds, you'll see the updated information roll in.
Taco retrieves up to 500 tasks from each connected service.

### Hide ("I can't act on this")

Often other people set priorities for us, or there's simply items you
can't actually make progress on right now (but aren't able to remove). 
Click "Hide" to remove them from the Taco's typical view. You can see
hidden tasks by clicking the "Toggle Hidden Tasks" menu icon.

### Top ("On my radar")

Just learn information which made a task much more important than it
was? Click "Top" to move it to the top of "Up next."

### Print

Create a PDF with all tasks, like to print, save, or email it.

### Email

Send yourself an email containing "Up next" items (like the daily
punchlist). Taco can also do this on a daily basis.

### Find-as-you-type filter

To see only a portion of "For later" tasks, click the magnifying
glass or press `/` (forward slash), then type a string. Here's how it
looks:

![Find as you type 1]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-1.jpg)
![Find as you type 2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-2.jpg)
![Find as you type 3]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/find-as-you-type-3.jpg)

To continue using Taco while the find-as-you-type filter remains active,
click outside of the search box or press Enter.

To remove the find-as-you-type filter, press click the "X" icon or press
Escape.

### Hide-able sidebar

Want to focus? To hide the "For Later" sidebar entirely, hit `\`
(backslash) or click the arrow at the far left edge of the screen. To
display "For Later" again, do the same thing.

Taco remembers your last-used option on any given browser, so it won't
interrupt your focus mode.

### Settings

Edit [Settings](https://tacoapp.com/connector), including connectors,
email summary frequency, and themes.

<a name="themes"></a>
#### Themes

We want Taco to be an environment you love to work in (or better, many
such environments). To that end, Taco provides a handful of custom
backgrounds as themes. Choose one or provide your own.

You can provide your own background image or color. Browse to the
"Themes" section of the Settings page and provide either the URL to a
background image or a Web (RGB) color code.

To choose an image, try [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) or 
[dA](http://www.deviantart.com/). Images with consistent brightness work best.
To choose a color, try [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/). 

To disable distinctive backgrounds, provide a neutral color like
[gray](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=444444).

#### Email summary

Start the day out right with a punchlist of where you left off.  Taco
can email you what's up next every weekday, every day, or only on
Mondays. We'd put a joke about [work-life balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_balance#Consequences_of_an_Imbalance)
here if we had one.
