## The Basics

Here's how to use Taco.

**Important**: Like Taco itself, this document is evolving and includes
freeform notes.

### Drag and drop ("I'm ready to work on this now")

Just click a task and drag it from For Later to Up Next, or vice versa.
It's that simple.

### Sync

Click the Sync icon to tell Taco to update its data from your connected
services. In 12-15 seconds, you'll see the updated information roll in.

### Hide ("I can't act on this")

Often other people set priorities for us, or there's simply items you
can't actually make progress on right now (but aren't able to remove). 
Click "Hide" to remove them from the Taco's typical view. You can see
hidden tasks by clicking the "Toggle Hidden Tasks" menu icon.

### Top ("On my radar")

Just learn information which made a task much more important than it
was? Click "Top" to move it to the top of "Up next."

### Print

Create a PDF with all tasks, like to print, save, or email it.

### Email

Send yourself an email containing "Up next" items (like the daily punchlist).

### Settings

Edit [Settings](https://tacoapp.com/connector), including connectors,
email summary frequency, and themes.

#### Themes

We want Taco to be an environment you love to work in (or better, many
such environments). To that end, Taco provides a handful of custom
backgrounds as themes. Choose one or provide your own.

As an advanced option, you can provide your own background image or
color. To provide a background image, add `?background=` and the URL to
the image. For example:

    https://tacoapp.com/tasks?background=http://the.url.com/wallpaper.png

[This URL](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?background=http://www.wallpaperup.com/uploads/wallpapers/2012/08/09/10146/bef21cf1a96204c390c5c32fb5221c51.jpg)
loads Taco with a different background. Images can reside on any Web
site, such as these [free hosts](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+image+hosting)).

To provide a solid color instead of a background image, add `?bgcolor=`
and the 6-digit RGB ("HTML color") code, like `FF00FF`. For example:

    https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=22884F

Here are examples with [green](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=22884F), 
[orange](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=A64D00), and 
[blue](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=2A4580). To choose a color, try 
[Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/). 

To disable distinctive backgrounds, provide a neutral color like
[gray](https://tacoapp.com/tasks?bgcolor=444444).

Once you've settled on a theme that you like, bookmark its URL to use it
on an ongoing basis. This may become easier.

#### Email summary

Start the day out right with a punchlist of where you left off.  Taco
can email you what's up next every weekday, every day, or only on
Mondays. We'd put a joke about [work-life balance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work%E2%80%93life_balance#Consequences_of_an_Imbalance)
here if we had one.
