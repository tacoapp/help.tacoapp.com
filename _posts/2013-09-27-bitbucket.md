# Setup

To connect Bitbucket with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Bitbucket." Bitbucket will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Bitbucket tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/bitbucket/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports up to 100 issues which are new or open 
([status](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Use+the+issue+tracker))
and assigned to you, from across all repositories.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g bi` (as in "go to
Bitbucket") to open Bitbucket in a new browser tab.
