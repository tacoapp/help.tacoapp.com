# Setup

To connect Producteev with Taco, from the Connectors page, click
"Producteev." Producteev will present a confirmation page like this:

![Sync Producteev tasks with OAuth]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/connectors/producteev/oauth.png)


# Behavior

Taco imports up tasks which are assigned to you and are not completed, from
across all workspaces.

## Keyboard shortcut

While using Taco, press the keyboard shortcut `g pr` (as in "go to
Producteev") to open Producteev in a new browser tab.
