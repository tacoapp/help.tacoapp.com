use – on to one screen. Read more on [tacoapp.com](https://tacoapp.com).

## Contact us

Problem, question, or idea? Here's 4 ways to reach [Troy](https://twitter.com/troyd) and [Jordan](https://twitter.com/fixie). We track comments religiously and we'll always respond, though it may not be immediately while we're hard at work on your Kickstarter backer reward.

### 1. Within Taco itself

There's a suggestion form right inside Taco. It's on the tasks page and
looks like this:

![Taco suggestion box]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/taco-suggestion.png)

We receive your name and email address, so we're able to reply.

### 2. Web form

Have a longer comment? Here's a [longer form](https://tacoapp.com/feedback).

### 3. Email

Time-tested email: `support` `@` `tacoapp.com`

### 4. Text chat

Indeed, we're human! We're often idle in [text chat](https://tacoapp.com/chat), especially during US Pacific (UTC-8) waking hours. 

**New to chat?** It's very easy to use, right inside your Web browser
(or your favorite IRC client). If you don't have a chat account, let us
know and we'll take care of it.
