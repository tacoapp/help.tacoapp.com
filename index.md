# How to contact us

Have a problem, question, or idea? Here's 4 ways to reach Troy and Jordan at Taco. We'll respond within 2 business days, often faster.

### 1. Within Taco itself

There's a suggestion form right inside Taco, though we did our best to make it blend in. It's on the main tasks page and looks like this:

![Taco suggestion box]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/taco-suggestion.png)

### 2. Web form

Have a longer comment? Pair it with a [much bigger form](https://tacoapp.com/feedback).

### 3. Text chat

Indeed, we're human. We're often idle in [text chat](https://tacoapp.com/chat), especially during US Pacific (UTC-8) waking hours.

### 4. Email

Time-tested email: `support` `@` `tacoapp.com`
