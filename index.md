## Help

Check the sidebar for an [introduction](/how-it-works/introduction.html) to Taco and information 
about each connector.

## Support

Have a problem, question, or idea? Here's 4 ways to reach [Troy](https://twitter.com/troyd) and [Jordan](https://twitter.com/fixie) at Taco. We'll respond within 2 business days, often faster.

### 1. Within Taco itself

There's a suggestion form right inside Taco, though we did our best to make it blend in. It's on the main tasks page and looks like this:

![Taco suggestion box]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/taco-suggestion.png)

### 2. Web form

Have a longer comment? Here's a [much bigger form](https://tacoapp.com/feedback).

### 3. Text chat

Indeed, we're human! We're often idle in [text chat](https://tacoapp.com/chat), especially during US Pacific (UTC-8) waking hours. 

**New to chat?** It's very easy to use, right inside your Web browser (or your favorite IRC client).

[Create](https://tacoapp.com/chat-signup) a chat account and choose a nickname for other participants to identify you. You'll see a link to join Taco's chat room. We recommend disabling chat notifications [here](https://grove.io/accounts/settings/notifications). Fans of chat can use an [IRC client](https://grove.io/help/irc/setup).

### 4. Email

Time-tested email: `support` `@` `tacoapp.com`
